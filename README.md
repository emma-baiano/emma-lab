**Welcome to emma-lab!**

My personal space where I experiment, build and document my journey through the world of IT. This lab is a collection of projects, tools, notes, and learning logs covering everything from web development and scripting to cybersecurity and beyond. Whether it's a polished portfolio piece or a messy work-in-progress, it's all part of the process.

##  Learning Activities

I document my learning journey here, including what I’m exploring, what worked and what didn’t.

- **Activity 1:** Explored Offensive Security basics. Learned how to hack a website legally in a safe environment and got a feel for an ethical hacker's job.

- **Activity 2:** Used a command-line application; Gobuster, to brute-force a website to find hidden directories and pages on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/emma.bee.me).

- **Activity 3:** [Linux Command Line Cheat Sheet](command-line-cheatsheet.md).
