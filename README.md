**Welcome to emma-lab!**

My personal space where I experiment, build and document my journey through the world of IT. This lab is a collection of projects, tools, notes, and learning logs covering everything from web development and scripting to cybersecurity and beyond. Whether it's a polished portfolio piece or a messy work-in-progress, it's all part of the process.

## About Me

Hi! I'm **Emma**, an IT student passionate about learning and building across multiple domains. I enjoy working on hands-on projects and documenting my progress as I explore the tech world.

##  Activities

I document my learning journey here including what I’m exploring, what worked and what didn’t.

**Activity 1:** Explored Offensive Security basics. Learned how to hack a website legally in a safe environment and got a feel for an ethical hacker's job.
**Activity 2:** Completed a simulation using a virtual machine, via [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/emma.bee.me), and used Gobuster Command to brute-force website pages.
